"The challenge for this year's (2024) hackathon was about how to implement AI in different contexts. I chose to work with the OpenAI (ChatGPT) API to create an AI for education. This AI can
generate stories about a given context and return three different stories. With the help of a Text-to-Speech AI, we can transform the text into voice.

Watch the video to understand how this app works."
